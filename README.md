##Assignment 1 - Luca Giacomelli

There are 3 files. 
The PeopleProfileSearcher.java does all the tasks required in lab 3.
The PeopleProfileReader.java does the un-marshalling for XML.
The PeopleProfileWriter.java does the marshalling for XML.
The PeopleProfileWriterJson.java does the marshalling for Json.

##Further notes
All the java applications need the people.xml and people.json to be there. In other word, both for un-marshalling and marshalling if the file is not found an exception will be thrown.
For running the evaluation with ant simply write ant (execute.evaluation is the dafault task).
